The following SAS code performs a chisquare analysis
comparing the proportions of vehicle type in a dataset 
(ie. bus, car, truck or van) with some test vector of
proportions.  With the test vector used, it didn't seem
to be outside of the expected proportions of vehicles from
the actual data.  This test was repeated to see if there
was a dependence of vehicle type on the city in which it
was observed.  This test and also the fisher exact test
showed no dependence on city for the vehicle type.  
Note that this is fake data and is not taken from any
actual sources.
